    prompt: "What are THE BENEFITS OF BUYING A NEW HOME VS. USED HOME ?",
    completion:
      "Hyde Homes knows that homeownership is a life-changing decision, which can be one of the most difficult questions you'll ever have to answer. Although it's been debated for years now what makes more sense: buying an existing home or buying a brand new construction home? The expert home builders in Alabama at Hyde, have some reasons why new homeownership just makes more sense.\n\nTHE ADVANTAGES OF BUYING NEW\n1) WARRANTY: Unlike a used home, all of our new constructions come with a warranty. You won't have to worry about replacing a roof, appliances, counter tops, etc. like you would in a used home. Your new home and all of the products that comprise it, are brand new and under warranty. Those components of your new home feature the latest designs and building materials and will offer years of comfort and performance before needing to be replaced.\n\n2) YOU DESIGN YOUR HOME JUST THE WAY YOU WANT IT: Buying new from Hyde Homes allows you to be involved in achieving the functionality and style that fits your specific needs. Why settle for choice's made by a previous home owner? Buying new allows you to select everything from cabinets, counter tops, flooring, lighting and other options that you love. Your new home will reflect your style, not someone else's. \n\n3) ENERGY EFFICIENCY: Today's new homes meet stringent energy standards and codes not in place in the past. Buying a new home is far more energy efficient than purchasing a home built even 5 years ago. \n\n4) FEWER REPAIRS: Simply put, your new home is new. New things don't usually break or have to be fixed. The features of a new construction home will hold up better than those of existing homes. Where a previously owned home has experienced years of wear and tear, a new home has no wear and tear and is specifically engineered to minimize maintenance. \n\n5) CUSTOMIZATION: When you buy new from Hyde Homes, you are in the driver's seat. You have full participation in the design process of your home. Want a Master Bedroom on the first floor? It's yours. Trey ceilings in the living room? Done! Perhaps you'd like granite in the kitchen? You got it! From a glamour tub in the Master bathroom to exposed stained wood beams in the family room. We make it easy to build your dream home. \n\n6) THAT NEW HOME FEEL: A used home was someone else's dream, not yours. A previously owned home reflects another families memories and choices. New homes offer the latest designs, quality, comfort and style selections. Buying new provides a care free lifestyle so that you can enjoy your home, not work on it.\n",
